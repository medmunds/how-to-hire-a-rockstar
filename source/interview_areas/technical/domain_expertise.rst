The Domain Expertise Interview
==============================

You'll recall that :ref:`we hire ability, <philosophy>` not just knowledge.
But we *do* expect candidates to have some current knowledge in their fields.
(It's definitely a red flag if the candidate shows a complete lack
of expertise in any relevant domain.)

Also, understanding what a candidate has learned in the past
can help indicate what he or she is capable of learning in the future.

* Find out *how* they acquired their domain expertise. E.g., "what technical area have you learned
  about most recently, why did you need to learn it, and how did you learn it?"

* If you're going to ask about quirks of a particular environment, be certain that those quirks
  are ones that any engineer would *absolutely* have to know to be successful in that environment.
  (Coding is not a trivia contest. That's what we have Google for. And Stack Overflow.)

* "I don't know exactly, but here's how I'd find the answer"
  is often a perfectly good response to a domain-specific question.

* Does their knowledge cover a breadth of domains (tools, programming languages, environments,
  etc.)? Have they shown a consistent history of picking up new domains? These are some of the
  best predictors of a candidate's ability to succeed.
