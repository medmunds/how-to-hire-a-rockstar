Technical Interviews
====================

We have three technical interviews:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   architecture
   coding
   domain_expertise

The next few pages go into detail on what each of these areas covers, but they're meant as
*guidelines* and starting points---not as checklists.

If you'll be conducting one of these interviews,
spend a few minutes ahead of time to figure out what you want to ask
and what directions you want to steer the conversation.
