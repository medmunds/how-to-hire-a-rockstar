Team-Sized Projects
===================

There are substantial differences between working alone and working on a team.
You'll want to make sure that candidates will be comfortable working on your code,
and that you'll be comfortable working on theirs.

* Have they worked on team projects? How big was the team? How big was the codebase?

* What was the division of labor? Did it change between releases? During the course of a single
  release?

* What tools did they use to help manage team-sized projects and codebases? Did they (personally)
  create any tools or processes to improve team efficiency or code quality?

* What bug/issue tracking systems have they used? Pluses and minuses?

* What revision control systems have they used? Positives and negatives? Do they have a religious
  objection to our choice of source code management?
  (Aside: using revision control even on solo projects is a great sign.)

* How will they feel about working with existing code? (You won't get a real answer if you ask
  this outright. Try digging into past situations where they've inherited code and what that
  experience was like for them.)

* What tools and techniques did they use to assure quality? (Continuous integration? Code
  reviews? Debugging libraries? Etc.)

* Have they ever rewritten (refactored) a substantial portion of the code during a
  release/iteration (or over the course of multiple iterations)?
  What kind of planning went into that? How did it work out?
