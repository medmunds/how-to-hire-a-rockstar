Interview Process
=================

Interviews are a lot of effort, for everyone involved. They consume multiple hours of the
engineering team's time, and usually take the candidate away from work. It's important that this
time not be wasted.

Our engineering interview process:

* Tries to weed out unlikely candidates early, before they spend time with the entire team

* Spends enough time with likely candidates to truly get to know them,
  so we (and they) can make a well-informed decision

* Takes some time before and after the interview to ensure the process runs smoothly and
  effectively

* Treats all candidates with respect, even if we don't end up making an offer. People we don't
  hire may end up working for partners, vendors, customers, or competitors. There's no value in
  making enemies.


The Pre-Interview
-----------------

All candidates should be pre-interviewed before bringing them in for a full interview round. The
pre-interview takes the form of a phone-screen or a brief in-person interview. It has two purposes:

* It confirms that the candidate's interest, availability, and compensation expectations match
  our own (handled by hiring manager or HR).

* It assesses background and technical skills to make sure the candidate is a plausible match
  (handled by hiring manager or team member).

Only the most-promising candidates from the pre-interview should be brought in for a full interview
round.


The Interview

Preparation
^^^^^^^^^^^

Our engineering interview covers a lot of ground, and takes a lot of time. Some preparation
beforehand will make sure everything runs smoothly.

* Figure out who's on the interviewing team: this should include the hiring manager, peers,
  people who will report to or be led by the candidate, and people from other groups or
  departments who will work closely with the candidate.

* Make sure everyone on the interviewing team is clear on what the position involves and what
  qualities and skills you're looking for.

* Divide up interview areas: everyone on the interview team should be assigned particular areas
  for their sessions, from the list earlier in this document. This ensures that every important
  area is covered by at least one person; it also helps avoid everyone asking the candidate the
  same questions.

* Make the schedule: a typical session will one hour. Some interviewers may want slightly more or
  slightly less time, but trying to schedule less than 45 minutes for a session guarantees that
  either you'll fall off schedule or you won't go deep enough to make a decision in your area.
  Include the follow-up session (see below) in the schedule.

* The hiring manager or coordinator should send out a complete interview schedule and resume to
  everyone who will be interviewing. Depending on your location, copy reception and/or HR on the
  schedule. Use a meaningful subject on the email (e.g., "Gerald Fang interview,
  Tuesday 1:00-5:00 p.m.", not "FW: Candidate").

* Reserve a conference room, if necessary. You don't want to waste your time (or the candidate's)
  searching for a private place to talk with them at the start of your session.


Interviewing Mechanics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Let reception (or whomever answers the door at your location) know the candidate is coming in
  and who he or she is speaking with first.

* Keep the candidate comfortable: Interviews are already stressful, and nobody's at their best when
  they're thirsty or desperately in need of a bathroom break. Offer to let them head for the
  kitchen/bathroom in between interviews, as you head off to find the next interviewer.

* Similarly, if the interview schedule runs the better part of the day, you'll need to make sure
  the candidate gets lunch and/or dinner at the appropriate times.

* Try hard to stay on schedule. There may be several interviews and other meetings intricately
  scheduled within a day, and if you push the schedule late, everything can fall apart.

* Make clean hand-offs between sessions. Let the candidate know who he or she will be speaking
  with next, and what they do. Make sure the next interviewer is aware that you are finished and
  they are on.

* If the hiring manager is not the final interviewer, he or she should usually return at the end
  of the schedule to check the candidate's impressions and discuss next steps. Let the candidate
  know when he or she will hear back from us (and then make sure it happens as promised!).

* Do not let two candidates cross. If you have two people interviewing for the same position on
  the same day, schedule them to arrive at different times and generally avoid each other. Do not
  take competing candidates out to lunch together. (A possible exception here is college
  recruiting, when there are several positions open for the same pool of candidates.)


Interviewing Techniques
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**You must reach a yes or no decision** about the candidate during your session (on the area you're
covering). Do everything you can to avoid exiting with a "maybe"---we can't hire "maybes".

* If you're unsure on an area, immediately ask follow-up questions that will help confirm or
  refute your initial impressions.

* Test the limits of their knowledge---dig until you can't get any further. For technical areas,
  you can use "what if" questions and on-the-fly requirements changes to probe beyond what you've
  already heard. ("How would your design have been different if you had to â€¦?")

* Don't be afraid to wait for an answer. You're asking tough questions---hopefully ones they
  haven't heard and memorized before---and they'll need time to think about their answers. Long
  pauses are OK.

* If you're getting snap answers that are poorly thought-out, it may just be interviewing jitters.
  Start your next question with something like, "Take a moment to think about how you
  did/would/have (rest of question)", to gently prompt the candidate that pausing to think is OK.

* Always start with what they actually did, not what they would or should do. ("How should an
  agile development process be implemented" will get you a textbook answer. "How did your agile
  development process work" will get you real information.)

* Don't accept stock answers, and don't be afraid to cut off memorized speeches---especially ones
  that don't answer the question you asked.

* Watch for "we". If all of a candidate's answers use "we", it may be modesty or a sense of team
  ownership, but it could also be that the candidate wasn't personally involved. Ask follow-up
  questions until it's clear.

* Be aware of "echoing". Clever interviewees will pick up concerns from earlier interviewers and
  then tailor their answers in later sessions to respond to (echo) these concerns. This isn't
  necessarily a bad thing (it shows a certain ability to think on the fly), but don't mistake this
  interview technique for deep and spontaneous insight into our needs.

* Ask open-ended questions, not yes-or-no ones.

* Don't guess or assume. Ask! Just because it's on their resume, or their name is in the product
  credits, or they allude to something, that doesn't make it so. Ask them to be sure.

Many of these techniques are part of an approach called "behavioral interviewing", which is highly
recommended for helping you arrive at a firm decision. There is a separate training presentation
available that covers behavioral interviewing techniques in more detail, and a lot of information
about behavioral interviewing can be found on the web.


Cutting It Off Early
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Extremely rarely, it will become apparent early in the interview schedule that a candidate
absolutely isn't going to fit. (Because of the pre-interview process, we will almost never bring
in a candidate who is a total wash-out, but it can occur.)

Only the hiring manager should cut the interview schedule short. If you've become certain that the
candidate is a complete mismatch, find the hiring manager at the end of the interview (rather than
handing off to the next interviewer), and explain the situation.

The hiring manager should talk to the candidate and try to assess why there was such a difference
between the pre-interview and the current session. If the interviewee is just having an incredibly
off day, the interview should be rescheduled. Or if the candidate misrepresented skills,
experience, or interest during the pre-interview, explain the problem and end the session.


The Follow-up Session
---------------------

After all of the interviews are completed, the interview team should get together and discuss the
candidate. Ideally, this should happen the same day, while the interviews are fresh in everyone's
minds.

Schedule this post-interview session at the same time you schedule the interviews. Don't rely on it
"just happening", as it probably won't.

There are three possible outcomes of this session:

* Hire the candidate---everyone agrees, based on their interview areas, that the candidate is a
  Rock Star Engineer.

* Reject the candidate---in at least one area, the candidate was clearly not rock star material.
  (A bunch of vague impressions or "maybes" also argue for rejecting the candidate.)

* More information needed---there are conflicting impressions or dissention.

This last outcome is something of a problem, as it's going to involve bringing the candidate back
in for another session.

For the return visit, make certain everyone understands what information was missing or conflicting
in the first round, and that there's a plan in place to reach a solid decision during the second
round. Be honest with the candidate ("we didn't get a consistent read on your commercial
development experience, and we'd like to have you back to explore this area more").
