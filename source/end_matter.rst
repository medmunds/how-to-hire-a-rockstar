Macromedia's then-VP of Engineering Joe Dunn first introduced me to the "How to Hire a Rock
Star" concept, many years ago. Unfortunately, Joe's original document was lost. I created this
version while at Simple Star, based on vague memories of Joe's document, but more importantly
based on the collective wisdom of the outstanding engineering teams, managers, technical
recruiters, and HR professionals I've worked with throughout the years---before, at, and after
Macromedia.

So while the title of this document can be attributed to Joe, the ideas in it come from a wide
range of sources. And this document's interpretation, mangling, and (likely) outright
misrepresentation of those ideas are all entirely my own fault.

(And Joe has since informed me that his version was based on something he'd encountered at a
former company. It seems likely that variations on this document have been circulating within
the tech industry for decades, both spontaneously created and adapted from existing documents.)
