The Interview Plan
******************

Interviews are a lot of effort, for everyone involved. They consume multiple hours of the
engineering team's time, and usually take the candidate away from work. It's important that this
time not be wasted.

Our engineering interview process:

* Tries to weed out unlikely candidates early, before we commit the entire team's time

* Spends enough time with likely candidates to truly get to know them,
  so we (and they) can make a well-informed decision

* Allocates some time before and after the interview to ensure the process runs smoothly and
  effectively

* Treats all candidates with respect, even if we don't end up making an offer

  People we don't hire may end up working for partners, vendors, customers, or competitors.
  (There's no value in making enemies.)
