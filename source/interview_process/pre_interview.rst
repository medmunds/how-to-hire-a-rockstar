The Pre-Interview
=================

All candidates should be pre-interviewed before bringing them in for a full interview round.
The pre-interview can be a phone screen or a brief in-person interview.
It has two purposes:

* It confirms that the candidate's interest, availability,
  and compensation expectations match our own.
  (This can be handled by the hiring manager or HR/recruiting.)

* It assesses background and technical skills to make sure the candidate is a plausible match.
  (This should be handled by hiring manager or a team member.
  Although HR/recruiting is able to do some filtering of the candidate pool,
  a sanity check on technical skills needs to come directly from one of us.)

Only the most-promising candidates from the pre-interview
should be brought in for a full interview round.
