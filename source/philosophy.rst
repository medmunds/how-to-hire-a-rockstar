Overriding Philosophy
=====================

One general philosophy applies to all of our hiring. It is this:

.. pull-quote::

   **We hire ability, not just knowledge.**


Some companies hire based solely on *what you know*: How long have you been programming in
C#/Java/ActionScript/Fortran? How do you implement a Java servlet/DirectShow filter/multithreaded
COM object/interactive stack for HD-DVD? What do you need to watch out for when porting an MFC
application to WPF/using CSS in Internet Explorer 6/writing a TWAIN driver that works on Windows
2000 and ME?

It's not that we object to knowledge; it's just that
*knowledge alone is insufficient to make someone a great engineer.* The problem with raw knowledge
is that it becomes dated---sometimes very rapidly (as you've perhaps noticed in the examples
above). Plus, there's a whole lot of knowledge out there that's irrelevant to what we do.

We hire ability, potential, aptitude. We hire people who not only know old things, but also
*know how to learn new things.* We hire Rock Star Engineers who want to work on products and ideas
that have never existed before, because that's what we're building.

It's easy to interview for knowledge. In fact, you can use a written test and not even bother with
the time and trouble of an interview.

Interviewing for ability takes more preparation and effort, but it's not that hard once you know
what you're looking for. And it pays off right away. That's what this guide is all about.
