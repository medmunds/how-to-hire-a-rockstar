Special Cases
=============

Hiring Friends and Past Colleagues
----------------------------------

The rule is simple: everyone gets a serious interview. It doesn't matter who you know or where
you've worked before. If you want to work here, the engineering team is going to make sure you're
up to our standards.

Good candidates will understand and respect this. In fact, they'll be suspicious if they don't get
an in-depth interview---it would suggest we're not careful about who we hire. (And good engineers
don't want to---or have to---work for companies that hire carelessly.)


Contractors
-----------

You should approach hiring for contract positions every bit as seriously as you'd approach hiring
a full-time engineer. Even if the contractor will only be working on the product for a few months,
we'll (you'll) have to deal with the code they create for a long time after they're gone. And many
people who start here as contractors end up joining the organization full-time later on.
