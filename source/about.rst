Author's Note and Credits
-------------------------

*How to Hire a Rock Star Engineer* is a collection of best practices
for interviewing great software developers.

This guide and its predecessors have helped engineering teams small and large,
early-stage and established, improve their hiring results.
And while I can confidently tell you that I've found it useful *in actual practice,*
you should of course form your own opinions.
(If you've got a better way, I encourage you to :ref:`improve on what I've written <adapt>`
and share it with the rest of us.)

I'm a some-time software engineer, engineering manager, and occasional startup executive
with `a bit of experience`_. I created my first version of this guide in 2005.
But its roots are much older.

Macromedia's then-VP of Engineering `Joe Dunn`_ introduced me to the "How to Hire a Rock Star"
concept in the late 90's, around the time I was transitioning into engineering management.
Sadly, I didn't keep a copy, and Joe's document seems to have been lost in that earlier millennium.

My attempt to recreate the guide was based partly on (hazy) memories of Joe's document,
but also drew on the collective wisdom of the many outstanding engineering teams,
managers, technical recruiters, and HR professionals I've worked with throughout the years.

So while the title of this work can be attributed to Joe, the ideas in it come from a wide
range of sources---before, at, and after Macromedia.
And any interpretation, mangling, and (likely) outright misrepresentation
of their ideas here is entirely my own fault.

(Joe has since informed me that his version was loosely based on something he'd encountered at a
former company. It seems likely that variations on this theme have been circulating within the tech
industry---and been spontaneously rediscovered---for decades.)

The guide been updated a few times since 2005, primarily to freshen the
technologies used as (recently-trendy) counterexamples in the :ref:`philosophy <philosophy>`
section.

For this update I'm calling "v3" I've completely restructured it for web consumption,
converted it to an easily-forked-and-adapted format,
and released it on GitHub under a Creative Commons license.
I hope you'll find it a helpful starting point to use with your own team.
