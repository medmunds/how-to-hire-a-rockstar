Introduction
============

Why this guide?
---------------

Our company is undergoing a period of dramatic change, in its products and its approach to
engineering. This is both an incredible opportunity and an incredible challenge:

* **Hiring is critical to our success.**
  We must grow the engineering team to be able to deliver on everything we need to deliver.
  Conversely, a single bad hire can drag down the entire team.

* **Hiring takes time.**
  A full interview round, covering all of the areas we consider important, can take 4--5 hours or
  more. Trying to shortchange the interviewing leads to bad hires.

* **Hiring is a team process.**
  With this much hiring and interviewing, every engineer will need to participate---not just
  managers and leads. (And besides, don't you want some say in whom you'll be working with?)

This guide is an attempt to make sure that everyone understands our hiring process
and that everyone's time interviewing is well-spent.


How to hire a Rock Star Engineer
--------------------------------

Hiring great engineers takes time and effort, but it's not all that complicated. All it takes is:

* Understanding our :doc:`overriding philosophy <philosophy>`
* Covering all of the :doc:`important areas <interview_areas>` during the interview
* Having an efficient, effective, well-planned :doc:`interviewing process <interview_process>`

This guide goes into detail on these areas. It also covers some
:doc:`special situations <special_cases>` that may arise.


How *not* to hire a Rock Star Engineer
--------------------------------------

For comparison, here are some hiring strategies I've actually seen used at previous companies.
Trust me, they don't work:

* "We need to fill the position quickly, and his resume looks good. Just get him in."
  (Any warm body will do. Except when his bugs delay the release, and then you have
  to go in and clean up all his code after him.)

* "He seems like a nice guy." (And he was, but he couldn't cut it technically. We ended
  up having to fire him, which was awful for everyone.)

* "She used to work with (employee), so we don't need to ask tough questions in the
  interview." (She got the impression we were technical lightweights, and took a job
  with a competitor.)
